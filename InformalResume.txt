My name is Andy Stubblefield, and I'm a 23 year-old college student. I 
currently attend Southern Illinois University Edwardsville majoring in Computer
Science with a minor in Business Administration. I attended high school at 
Wesclin Sr. High in Trenton, Illinois. Some of my other interests (other than
gaming) include photography, ice hockey, playing the guitar, and blogging.

My previous work history includes the Illinois Air National Guard, Southern
Illinois University Edwardsville, and a local restaurant called Dairy King.

I enlisted in the Illinois Air National Guardin September of 2004, and am still
employed there. I did engine work for C-130 cargo aircraft, but I recently
changed career fields and am now involved with the management of aircraft and
other critical resources.

I worked for Southern Illinois University Edwardsville in the Morris University
Center administration office from August 2008 to September 2010. I started as a
student secretary, but in December of 2008, I was promoted to Marketing Manager
of the Morris University Center.

During High School, I worked as a cashier/cook/janitor for a local restaurant, 
Dairy King. I started working there in September of 2003, and left when I went 
to college in December of 2006.
